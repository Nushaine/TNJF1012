Description: A Pokedex is a device that is given to Pokémon trainers who are starting their journey used in the show Pokémon which is a show about creatures captured by their trainers that identifies and explains Pokémon types and gives out descriptions and information about each Pokémon including where it came from and what weaknesses and strengths it has against other Pokémon by comparing the elemental advantages between them however in the show and games the Pokedex only gives out full information to trainers if the Pokémon are captured and so we decided to make a webpage that’s an already filled Pokedex with all the information about the X and Y generation of Pokémon.
